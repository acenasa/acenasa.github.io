In ICS 212 Program Structure, a class I took in Spring 2024, we were tasked with designing a card deck simulator that mimics the functionality of a real deck of cards. The program starts by creating a complete deck of 52 playing cards, each with a specific rank (like Ace or King), suit (like Hearts or Spades), and color (red or black). Once the deck is created, it can be shuffled randomly to simulate a real-life shuffle. The shuffled cards are displayed in groups of three for readability, and the user is given the option to shuffle again. This process helps ensure no two cards are identical and that the deck behaves exactly as expected in card-based games.

The course was online and asynchronous under Professor William "Bill" Wright at Leeward Community College, and I sometimes used ChatGPT to debug and improve the program without over-relying on AI tools.

The program passed with flying colors. I incorporated modern programming techniques, such as using random number generators for shuffling and organizing card properties efficiently with structures and vectors. Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience in debugging and refining code for real-world applications, thanks to occasional guidance from Professor Wrightâ€™s course materials. Completing this project gave me a deeper appreciation for C/C++ programming and furthered my confidence in designing structured, functional programs independently.
