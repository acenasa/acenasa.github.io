summary: "The benefits of ashwagandha that I wrote about in a research paper for ENG 100."
---

In ENG 100, a course I took in-person under Professor Jason Jayaprakash at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, we were tasked with writing an argumentative essay to persuade readers to support a specific topic. For my essay, I chose to highlight the benefits of Ashwagandha, a traditional Ayurvedic herb, focusing on its holistic impact on physical and mental health. The paper outlined the herb’s ability to enhance strength, reduce stress, combat obesity, and improve sleep. It also incorporated credible sources, including peer-reviewed studies and personal experience, to build a compelling argument. The project spanned multiple weeks, requiring detailed research, revisions, and a properly formatted Works Cited page to meet academic standards.

Jason and my peers received the essay well, commending its clear organization and the evidence-based approach I took to support my claims. To refine my writing and ensure grammatical accuracy, I occasionally used ChatGPT for minor corrections, though the content and arguments were entirely my own. The experience helped me sharpen my persuasive writing skills while learning to present scientific information in an accessible and engaging way. Completing this essay not only improved my understanding of Ashwagandha’s health benefits but also deepened my appreciation for the power of research-driven argumentation in academic writing.
