TypeScript? I've heard of JavaScript.

## Is it like JavaScript's younger brother?

No. But that is what I thought it was at first. My initial thought as a complete newbie was that TypeScript was a coding language very similar to JS, like how C is closely related to C++. Turns out I was wrong. TypeScript is a supercharged version of JavaScript, the kind of language that looked at JavaScript and said, "What if we gave you types and made debugging slightly less of a nightmare?" And honestly, after dealing with JavaScript's occasional surprises, I can see why TypeScript exists.

## Is TypeScript a good programming language?

From a software engineering perspective, I can see the appeal. TypeScript forces you to be explicit about your data types, which means fewer "undefined is not a function" errors haunting your dreams at 2 AM. It's like JavaScript finally went to the gym, did some squats, and came back with a little more structure in its life. That said, as someone new to TypeScript, I'm still getting used to its quirks. It's not badâ€” just different.

## WODs: This wasn't part of my workout plan

Ah yes, the WODs. The workout of the day. Except instead of walking on a treadmill to burn calories, I'm using my fingers to frantically write code before the timer runs out. I will admit, this method keeps me engaged, but the sheer number of them? It's like my professor looked at our schedules, saw we had free time on weekends, and said, "Yeah no." Is it stressful? A little. Do I prefer it over sitting in a lecture and then blanking out on a test question later? For sure.

## Is this style of learning for me?

Honestly, I wouldn't say this is my ideal way of learning, but I'd take it over traditional note-taking and exams any day. The constant practice keeps me from slacking off, and I actually feel like I'm learning something instead of just memorizing terms for a test. That said, I wouldn't mind a slight reduction in the WOD intensity- maybe a "rest day" here and there? Just a thought.

All in all, TypeScript seems promising, the WODs keep me on my toes, and my stress levels are... manageable (for now). If nothing else, this experience will at least make me a faster typist. Silver linings, right?
